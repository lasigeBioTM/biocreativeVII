# lasigeBioTM at BioCreative VII Track 1: Text mining drug and chemical-protein interactions using biomedical ontologies

This repository contains the material used to participate in **BioCreative VII Track 1 - Text mining drug and chemical-protein interactions (DrugProt)**, through the adaptation of the [BiOnt](https://github.com/lasigeBioTM/BiOnt) system, using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) ontologies.

Our academic paper which describes our participation (**lasigeBioTM**) in the BioCreative VII will be available [here]().
